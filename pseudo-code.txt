Crystals Pseudo Code:

1.	Create an integer variable for wins, set it to zero, display it on screen, and log it.

2.	Create an integer variable for losses, set it to zero, display it on screen, and log it.

3.	Create an integer variable for random number, set it to random number between 19 and 120, display it on screen, and log it.

4.	Create an integer variables for crystals 1-4, set them to random numbers from 1-12, and log them.

5.	Create an integer variable for total score, set it to zero, display it on screen, and log it.

6.	When a user clicks on a crystal link (1-4)

		Add the random score associated with crystal to total score.

		If total score > then random integer variable from step 3

			The user loses

			Add 1 to losses
			
			Log it

			Restart the game from step 3

		else if total score = random integer variable from step 3

			The user wins

			Add 1 to wins

			Log it

			Restart the game from step 3

		else	continue waiting for user to click another crystal (step 6)
